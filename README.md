# Problem_set_7_Bayes2

This week we will explore Confidence the Monte Carlo. This is primarily covered in the second half of the lectures for this week (~slide 90)

In the lecture we covered conducting a monte carlo for finding the theta associated with flipping a coin. 


# Background

Genetic variants are considered rare in the human population if they have a frequency of < 0.05 or 5%. You are attempting to find the frequency of a SNP called RS12 in the United States Population. However, you only have 90 samples from various cities across the US. This data is stored in the file. 

# Question Set A

You get the frequency data and decide to observe the dataset. Plot the frequency data in a histogram

## Question A1
Does the frequency data look normally distributed?

## Question A2
What is the mean frequency of RS12 across all sample locations?



# Question Set B 

Possible values for the true frequency of the RS12 SNP could be 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06 or 0.07. 

You hypothesize that the true frequency of RS12 is < 0.05. You are going to test this using the Bayes Box framework for hypothesis testing.
